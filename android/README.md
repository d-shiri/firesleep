# FireSleep — Android TV app

Single-module Kotlin + Jetpack Compose app, sideloaded onto a Fire TV Stick.
Depends only on Compose, androidx.security, and OkHttp. Designed for every
Fire TV Stick generation (minSdk 22); tested on a Fire TV Stick 4K Max.

The app is deliberately **TV-brand-agnostic** — it makes one HTTP POST to a
bridge service on your LAN. All vendor-specific logic (pairing, WebSocket
chatter, etc.) lives in `../server/`. Tested end-to-end with an LG webOS
set; PRs welcome for other brands (see top-level README).

## Build

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

(Requires JDK 17+. First build pulls Gradle 8.9 via the wrapper.)

## Install

```bash
adb connect <FIRE_TV_IP>:5555
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Permissions used

| Permission                       | Why                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `INTERNET`                       | POST to the bridge on your LAN           |
| `WAKE_LOCK`                      | Keep the device awake during countdown   |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`             | Host the timer while app is backgrounded |
| `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM` | Exact timer via AlarmManager    |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`             | Foreground-service notification          |

No storage, location, Bluetooth, camera, or mic. Cleartext HTTP is allowed
app-wide (Android won't restrict it to a CIDR), but the app only ever talks
to one user-entered LAN IP on `:8765`.

## Focus model

All four screens use a single `Modifier.focusable().onKeyEvent { … }` at the
root of the screen. Key events are dispatched to the focused screen
container, which updates an internal "which row / which column is focused"
index. No per-element `focusable()` calls inside the ladders or reels, which
means nothing can "lose" focus when the state updates.

`Key.DirectionCenter`, `Key.Enter`, and `Key.NumPadEnter` all fire the select
action — Fire TV remotes use `DirectionCenter`; USB keyboards during
development use `Enter`.
